      "description": "Aloe Vera is a succulent plant species known for its medicinal properties and easy care requirements. Its thick, fleshy leaves contain a clear gel that has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and skincare. This versatile plant is perfect for beginners and experienced plant enthusiasts alike.",
      "size": "Mature plants reach 12-24 inches (30-60 cm) in height and width. Growth is relatively slow, making it suitable for various spaces.",
      "toxicity": "Mildly toxic to pets and humans if ingested. The latex layer between the skin and gel can cause digestive upset. Keep out of reach of children and pets. The topical gel is safe for external use.",
      "benefits": [
        "Air purifying - removes toxins from indoor air",

      ],
      "care": {
        "watering": "Water deeply but infrequently. Allow the soil to dry completely between waterings, typically every 2-3 weeks. Reduce watering in winter to once a month. Overwatering is the most common cause of problems.",
        "light": "Bright, indirect sunlight is ideal. Can tolerate some direct morning sun but avoid harsh afternoon rays which can scorch the leaves. Place near a south or west-facing window for best results.",
        "temperature": "Thrives in temperatures between 55-80°F (13-27°C). Can tolerate brief drops to 40°F (4°C) but protect from frost. Prefers consistent temperatures without sudden fluctuations.",
        "humidity": "Prefers low to moderate humidity (40-50%). This drought-tolerant plant adapts well to typical indoor humidity levels. No misting required.",
        "soil": "Well-draining cactus or succulent mix is essential. You can create your own by mixing regular potting soil with coarse sand or perlite in a 2:1 ratio. Good drainage prevents root rot.",
        "fertilizing": "Feed sparingly with a diluted succulent fertilizer once in spring and once in summer. Use half the recommended strength. Avoid fertilizing in fall and winter when growth slows."

        {
          "issue": "Leaves turning brown at tips",
          "solution": "Can be caused by fluoride in tap water or over-fertilization. Use filtered water and reduce fertilizer application. Trim brown tips with clean scissors."
